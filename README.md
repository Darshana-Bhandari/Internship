### Day 9 — `day9.js` + `day9_calculator.html` · *Advanced Array Methods & Calculator UI*

Expanded knowledge of JavaScript arrays by learning powerful built-in array methods used for searching, modifying, transforming, and processing data.

#### Array Methods Practiced

##### includes()

* Checked whether a specific element exists in an array
* Returns `true` if found and `false` if not found

##### indexOf()

* Found the index position of an element
* Returns `-1` when the element does not exist

##### sort()

* Arranged array elements in alphabetical order

##### reverse()

* Reversed the order of array elements

##### splice()

* Removed elements from an array

* Learned how to modify existing arrays

##### forEach()

#### Day 9 Task — `day9_calculator.html` · Calculator UI (Tailwind CSS)

Built the front-end of a calculator app using Tailwind CSS:

* Glassmorphism design with backdrop blur and gradient background
* Animated floating background shapes
* Live digital clock in the header

* Hover and press micro-interactions on buttons (`btn-press` class)
* Google Fonts (Poppins) integration
* Display screen with a history line and main input readout

**Note:** On Day 9 this task covered only the UI/markup and the live clock script. The calculator logic was completed on Day 10 (see below).

---

### Day 10 — `day10_dom_events.html` + Calculator Logic · *DOM Manipulation & Event Listeners*

Learned how JavaScript interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model) and how to make pages interactive using event listeners.

#### DOM (Document Object Model)

* Understood the DOM as a tree-like representation of an HTML document
* Learned how JavaScript uses the DOM to read/change text, styles, and elements, and to handle events

#### Element Selection Methods

* `getElementsByClassName()` — selecting elements by class name
* `getElementsByTagName()` — selecting elements by tag name
* `getElementById()` — selecting a single element by ID
* `querySelector()` — selecting the first matching element
* `querySelectorAll()` — selecting all matching elements

#### innerHTML

* Used `innerHTML` to read and update the content of HTML elements

#### Events & Event Listeners

* Learned what an event is (click, mouseover, change, submit, load, etc.)
* Learned what an event listener is and how it runs a function in response to an event
* Practiced `addEventListener("click", ...)` with an alert popup
* Explored other common events: `mouseover`, `change`, `submit`, `load`

#### Day 10 Task — Completing the Calculator Logic (`day9_calculator.html`)

Finished the calculator built on Day 9 by adding full JavaScript functionality:

* `appendToDisplay()` — adds digits/operators to the display, clearing placeholder `0` or `Error`
* `clearDisplay()` — resets the display and history (AC button)
* `backspace()` — removes the last character from the display (⌫ button)
* `calculate()` — evaluates the expression, converting calculator symbols (`×`, `÷`, `−`, `%`) into valid JavaScript operators before using `eval()`
* Wired up all `data-value` and `data-action` buttons dynamically using `querySelectorAll()` and `addEventListener()`
* Added full **keyboard support** (number keys, `+ - * /`, `%`, `Enter`/`=`, `Backspace`, `Escape`) so the calculator works without clicking
* Handled error states (e.g., invalid expressions show `Error`)
